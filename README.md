Final project includes two files: knights_tour_graph.py and adj_list_graph.py 

It is configured to run a single search starting at vertex 0, which can be set to any vertex.

Comments provides details to run 64 searches, 
with a search starting at each vertex or range of vertices from 0 to 63. 

Details are discussed and demonstrated in the video uploaded to canvas. 

Note there are recommendations to toggle off some displays for multi search 
or you get lots of data that you may want to suppress. 

Details are in the comments and in the video.
